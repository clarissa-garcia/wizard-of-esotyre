# The Wizard of Esotyre

This repo was a mirror from a LoboGit repo. It is phase 2 of The Wizard of Esotyre, a final Unity class project for advanced game development in my senior year at the University of New Mexico. 

## Overview
The Wizard of Esotyre is a first-person puzzle game in which the player lives in a wizardâ€™s tower in the Forest of Esotyre. Each day, the player receives a list of tasks under their door and must complete the tasks before the sun sets. The tasks require the player to create magical potions and enchantments from resources in their storage cabinet or in the forest. 

## How to Play 

For easier access to the game, please visit the game on itch.io at https://nlivingstone.itch.io/wizard-of-esotyre. 

Walk around with WASD and move your camera with the mouse. Press B to open the recipes and use your mouse to cycle through them. Press E to open doors. Click to gather resources. You've been given a recipe book. In the top right of the screen you'll see a quest guiding you what to do.  Resources have been scattered throughout the map, and the quest list in the top right gives you hints as to their location. When you hover over resources with your cursor they will light up. Collect resources and craft items to progress through the game. Esc to open the pause menu/exit game. 

## Features I Worked On
I was in charge of a lot of UI elements including the back-end functionality in C# for corresponding elements. Some of these tasks included:
* Placing buttons, resizing, and adding back-end functionality for the buttons to interact with other Unity items. 
* Allowing user elements clicked in the world to be translated into user inventory and vice versa.
* Creating the functionality for the spell enchantment UI including clicking on syllables, populating them on a table, and clearing them completely from the board.
* Constructing the inventory for the user as they travel and collect items in the world including the back-end logic of item quantity, shifting items in the bag to fill vacancies from left to right, recognizing whether an item is new to the inventory or must have its quantity of an existing item in the bag incremented, and removal/placement of items from inventory to the world and vice versa. 

## What I Learned
I learned more about Unity and the way that scripts are attached in that game engine. I honed my skills in C# and learned to have user experience in mind when designing, creating, and working with UI elements.
